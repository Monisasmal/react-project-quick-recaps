# Traffic Light Simulation 🚦

A **Traffic Light Simulation** built using **React (Vite setup)** that demonstrates how real-world traffic lights
work by switching between **Red, Yellow, and Green** signals automatically.

## 🚀 Project Overview (Interview Explanation)

This project simulates a real-world **traffic light system** using React.  
It focuses on **state management**, **timing control**, and **conditional rendering**.

The application automatically cycles through traffic light states in a fixed sequence, similar to real traffic signals.

⚙️ How It Works (Interview Ready)

- The app maintains the current light state using React state
- A timer (setTimeout / setInterval) controls when the light changes
- Lights switch in this order:
  -  🔴 Red
  -  🟡 Yellow
  -  🟢 Green
- Conditional rendering updates the UI based on the current state
- The cycle repeats continuously
