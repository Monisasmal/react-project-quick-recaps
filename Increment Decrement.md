# React Increment & Decrement App 🔢

A simple React application that demonstrates **increment and decrement functionality** using **three different React Hooks**:
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useReducer`

This project is built to clearly explain **how different hooks manage state and logic** in React.
