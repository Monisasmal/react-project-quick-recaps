# Word Connect Game

Word Connect is a React-based word puzzle game where users connect letters to form valid words.  
I handled game logic and state using React Hooks, implemented routing for multiple screens, and used Chart.js to visualize user progress and performance.  
The app is responsive, interactive, and built with clean, reusable components.
