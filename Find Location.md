# Find Location App

Find Location is a React application that integrates Leaflet maps using React Leaflet.  
I implemented interactive maps with markers and zoom controls, managed map rendering using React Hooks, and styled the UI with custom CSS.  
The project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party libraries and work with geolocation-based UIs.
