# Find Location App

Find Location is a React application that integrates Leaflet maps using React Leaflet.  
I implemented interactive maps with markers and zoom controls, managed map rendering using React Hooks, and styled the UI with custom CSS.  
The project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party libraries and work with geolocation-based UIs.

## **Tech Stack Used**
- React (v19)
- React Leaflet
- Leaflet
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React Hooks
- Custom CSS

---

## **Key Features**
- Interactive map rendering using Leaflet
- Display map tiles and zoom controls
- Marker placement to highlight locations
- Dynamic map updates based on user interaction
- Responsive map layout
- Clean and minimal UI
- Fast loading and smooth interaction


---

## **Your Contributions**
- Built the application using React functional components
- Integrated Leaflet maps using `react-leaflet`
- Configured map container, tile layers, and markers
- Managed map state and interactions using React Hooks
- Styled the application layout with custom CSS
- Ensured responsive behavior across devices
- Set up the project with Vite for fast development and builds

## **Why These Technologies**
- **React:** Component-based UI and state-driven rendering
- **Leaflet:** Lightweight and powerful open-source mapping library
- **React Leaflet:** Easy integration of Leaflet with React components
- **Vite:** Fast dev server and optimized production builds
- **Custom CSS:** Full control over layout and styling

## **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Rendering maps correctly in React:**  
  Solved using `react-leaflet` components like `MapContainer` and `TileLayer`
- **Handling map resizing and responsiveness:**  
  Used flexible CSS and container sizing
- **Managing map interactions:**  
  Leveraged Leaflet’s built-in zoom and pan features

---

## **How Map Functionality Works**
- The map is rendered using `MapContainer`
- Tile layers load map visuals from a provider
- Markers are placed at specified coordinates
- Users can zoom and pan the map
- React manages re-rendering when state or props change
