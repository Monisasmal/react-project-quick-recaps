# React Location Finder App 📍

I built a React Location Finder app using Leaflet and React-Leaflet.
The map is rendered as a React component, while Leaflet handles map tiles and interactions.
This project helped me understand how to integrate third-party libraries into React and manage UI rendering efficiently.
