# ⌨️ Typing Speed Tester — React App

A modern Typing Speed Tester built with React that measures typing performance in real time. 
Users can start a timed typing session, select difficulty levels, and track WPM, accuracy, and mistakes — with score history saved for review.

This project demonstrates React fundamentals including state management, timers, controlled inputs, and performance calculations.
