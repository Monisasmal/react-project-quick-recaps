**Tech Stack Used:**  
React | Vite | JavaScript | Plain CSS / Custom CSS

**One-Line Summary:**  
A blog application frontend built using React + Vite.

**Key Features (as per repo):**  
- Static/reactive UI with JS + CSS

**My Contribution (as developer):**  
- Setup project using Vite + React  
- Built UI components and styling manually (no UI library)  
- Managed component-level state using React hooks / JS  
- Configured build and project structure  

**Why these technologies:**  
- Vite → faster dev build & HMR, lightweight compared to CRA  
- Plain CSS → flexible styling without heavy dependencies or learning curve  
- React → component-based UI and familiarity  

**Challenges (likely) & Solutions:**
