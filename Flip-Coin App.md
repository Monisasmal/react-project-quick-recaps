# ✅ Flip-Coin App

Flip-Coin is a minimal React + Vite app that lets the user click a button to flip a coin; the app randomly picks Heads or Tails and shows the result instantly. I wrote the flip logic myself using JavaScript and React Hooks, built all UI and styling with custom CSS, and kept the project simple and dependency-free to focus on core React fundamentals.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Flip coin functionality — user triggers a flip action (e.g., button click)
